        <p>
            The band released their debut EP, <em>Vancouver</em>,
in 2006 on <b>Friction Records</b>
            and then temporarily signed to
<b>Forest Life records</b>
            where they released <em>Here, Hear.</em>

            in May 2008. Their debut album <em>Somewhere at the Bottom of the River

        <h2>Logo and band name</h2>
        <p>
            The band has always used a band logo similar to what they do now.
 <b>La Dispute</b>
            started to use a redrawn, computer generated version of
  their logo as of October 2010. The band's name is from the <em>Pierre
  de Marivaux</em>
            work from 1774 of the same name, it was a play <em>Dreyer</em>
            watched while in high school and felt parallels between the work
    and the music he was writing at the time.





        </p>
        <h2>Musical style</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Jordan Dreyer</em>, the band's singer, has commented on the use of tags to
describe the band's style, saying:
            <u>
                <i>"In general, I think boxing art into
categories only serves as a way to exclude people from exploring different
variations of the same thing. I think the only real definition between
artists exists in their intentions for creating art ..."</i>
            </u>.
            But despite this
            <b>La Dispute</b>
            is described as playing <em>jazz, blues and spoken word</em>
            influenced
<em>post-hardcore</em>
            which incorporates elements which range through
<em>screamo, progressive rock, post-rock</em>
            and <em>hardcore
punk</em>.
Well recognized elements of <b>La Dispute</b>'s music are incorporating
<em>spoken word</em>
            style passages into intense songs, the use of highly complex lyrics
and <em>Jordan Dreyer's</em>
            versatile control of his voice; able to swap between singing
and screaming to correspond and compliment to the emotion of the music and the
lyrics. The band's instrumentation is seen as <i>"near-shoegaze guitar
drones that complemented the distorted bass"</i>
            and this couples with their
music being like <i>"confessional diary entries; spoken and shouted-word lyrics
accompanied by minor-chord harmonies"</i>. The music on their first album <em>Somewhere
at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair</em>
            is seen as blending elements
of <em>punk, progressive rock, emo</em>
            and <em>metalcore</em>. The band's second album,
<em>Wildlife</em>
            showed a lighter approach to music, compared to both their debut
album and mini album, combining elements from both the split albums they
wrote with <b>Touché Amoré</b>
            and <b>Koji</b>
            respectively. <em>Wildlife</em>
            was written
differently in comparison to the band's previous work, as the lyrics
and concept were written before the music. <em>Wildlife</em>'s lyrics follow
a loosely thematic collection of <i>"short stories"</i>
            examining the life
struggles that shape and define us as individuals. The band drew
inspiration from real issues and true stories that they themselves
had confronted or heard of in their home town of Grand Rapids.
A primary example of this is the track <u>King Park</u>
            which focuses
on the story of an inner city drive-by shooting. The band was
noted for combining the energetic dynamics of hardcore punk
with the introspective elements of emo and focusing on simpler,
melodic chord changes.
